# Heart Disease Risk Prediction using MLP

A machine learning project that predicts heart disease risk using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The project includes model training, evaluation, and a Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.

## 📊 Overview

This project uses the Heart Disease Health Indicators dataset to train an MLP classifier that predicts whether a person has heart disease based on various health and lifestyle factors. The model achieves good performance using a two-hidden-layer neural network architecture.

**Built with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust, replacing the need for pip and traditional virtual environment management.

## 🚀 Features

- **MLP Neural Network**: Two-layer neural network (128, 64 neurons) with ReLU activation
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Automated feature scaling and encoding
- **Interactive Web App**: Streamlit-based interface for real-time predictions
- **Model Persistence**: Saved model and metadata for easy deployment
- **Performance Metrics**: ROC-AUC evaluation for binary classification

```bash
uv run streamlit run app_mlp.py
```

The web app provides:

- Interactive sidebar inputs for all features
- Real-time heart disease risk prediction
- Probability scores and binary predictions

## 📊 Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Numeric Features**: MinMaxScaler normalization
2. **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoding with unknown category handling
3. **Target Encoding**: "Yes"/"No" → 1/0

## 🎯 Performance & Evaluation

The model's performance is comprehensively evaluated using multiple metrics to ensure robust assessment across different aspects of binary classification.

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics

**Classification Metrics:**
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **Balanced Accuracy**: Accuracy adjusted for class imbalance
- **Precision (Macro/Weighted)**: Positive prediction accuracy
- **Recall (Macro/Weighted)**: True positive detection rate
- **F1-Score (Macro/Weighted)**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

**Probabilistic Metrics:**
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
- **PR-AUC**: Area under the Precision-Recall curve (Average Precision)

**Additional Analysis:**
- **Classification Report**: Detailed per-class performance breakdown
- **Confusion Matrix**: True vs predicted label distribution
- **ROC Curve**: True Positive Rate vs False Positive Rate visualization
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Precision vs Recall trade-off visualization

🏆 Model Selection
Model Selection Rationale: After comprehensive comparison of multiple algorithms in the jupyter_notebook branch (XGBoost, Linear SVM, Logistic Regression, MLP), the MLP neural network was selected as the final model due to its superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics, particularly:

Highest overall accuracy and balanced accuracy
Best ROC-AUC score indicating strong discriminative ability
Optimal precision-recall trade-off for heart disease prediction
Robust performance on both macro and weighted averages

## 🔮 Making Predictions

The trained model can predict:

- **Probability**: Likelihood of heart disease (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Binary Prediction**: Yes/No classification (threshold: 0.5)

## 🚀 Deployment

The Streamlit app can be easily deployed to various platforms:

- **Streamlit Cloud**: Direct deployment from GitHub
- **Heroku**: Using Procfile and requirements.txt
- **Docker**: Container-based deployment
- **Local Server**: Run locally for development/testing
